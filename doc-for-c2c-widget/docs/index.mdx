# Introduction to the Call Widget

The Call Widget is a Click-to-Call style JavaScript widget which uses the SignalWire SDK and the SignalWire C2C service 
to allow you to embed calls in your website. 
The calls can be routed to a phone number, a SIP address, custom AI agents, custom SWML scripts, and nearly infinite combinations of the above.

Usage of the Call Widget:

```html
<!-- wherever in the html, your button -->
<button id="callButton">Call</button>

<!-- end of body -->
<c2c-widget
  buttonId="callButton"
  callDetails='{"destination":"/private/demo-1","supportsVideo":true,"supportsAudio":true}'
  token="<token>"
></c2c-widget>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@niravcodes/call-widget@1.0.0/dist/c2c-widget.umd.min.js" defer></script>
```

## CDN URL

The CDN URL is https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@niravcodes/call-widget@1.0.0/dist/c2c-widget.umd.min.js. This is a temporary URL, and will be put in `cdn.signalwire.com` later (maybe).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@niravcodes/call-widget@1.0.0/dist/c2c-widget.umd.min.js" defer></script>
```

But if you don't want to use the CDN, you can put the widget.js file wherever you want, and then include it like this:

```html
<!-- near end of body -->
<script src="/path/to/widget.js" defer></script>
```


## Go to [Usage](usage/index.mdx)

## Go to [Developer notes](developer/index.mdx)

import C2CWidget from "@site/src/components/C2CWidget";

The buttons below are created by the react wrapper for the widget. 

The react wrapper is used as follows:

import token from "./_token"

```jsx
<C2CWidget
  destination="/private/demo-1"
  supportsVideo={true}
  supportsAudio={true}
  token={token}
>Call with Video</C2CWidget>
```

<C2CWidget
  destination="/private/demo-1"
  supportsVideo={true}
  supportsAudio={true}
  token={token}
>Call with Video</C2CWidget>

<C2CWidget
  destination="/private/demo-3"
  supportsVideo={false}
  supportsAudio={true}
  token={token}
>Call only audio 2</C2CWidget>

<C2CWidget
  destination="/private/demo-4"
  supportsVideo={false}
  supportsAudio={true}
  token={token}
>Call only audio 3</C2CWidget>
