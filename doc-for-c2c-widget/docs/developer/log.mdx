- Surge wasn't working reliably(Frequent server errors and a lot of downtime for me). I have switched to GitHub pages.

   Now, if you have:

    a. write access to the `temp-c2c-widget` repo

    b. configured your ssh keys with github. [*help](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

    then you can deploy the docs by running `npm run deploy` from the root of the repo.
