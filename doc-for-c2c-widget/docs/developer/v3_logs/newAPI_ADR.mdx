# New API ADR

I am changing the API for the v3. Logging decisions and reasons here.

1. `<c2c-widget>` is now `<call-widget>`. This allows me to retain compatibility behavior of the old API, and make the 
    new API more flexible

2. instead of tracking change for attributes, (codecs, call details etc) we simply pull them at dial.

3. in v3, client gets initialized as soon as the widget is connected to the DOM.
    This is different from v2, where client was initialized before dial. 
    This is to get incoming calls.


## Client params vs Call params

Certain params are passed during client init, and other params during dial. 

### Client params

- token
- debug options 

### dial time params

- destination
- supportsAudio
- supportsVideo
- userVariables
- audioCodecs
