# Using the C2C Widget with Webflow

Put something like the following at the end of body section in webflow:

```html
<!-- START for call [nirav]-->
   <style>
   /* This class will be removed from button when the widget loads.
   */
   .demo-button-disabled {
     opacity: 0.7;
     pointer-events: none;
   }
   </style>

	 <!-- add widgets -->
   <c2c-widget
      buttonId="demo-1"
      callDetails='{"destination":"/private/demo-1","supportsVideo":true,"supportsAudio":true}'
      token="<token>"
   ></c2c-widget>

   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@signalwire/call-widget/dist/c2c-widget-full.umd.min.js"></script>
<!-- END for call [nirav]-->
```

In webflow, set the triggering button's id to match `buttonId`.

Set the button to also have the class `demo-button-disabled`. 
The widget, on load, will remove this class. And make it clickable again.
