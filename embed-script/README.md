The Call Widget is a Click-to-Call style JavaScript widget which uses the SignalWire SDK and the SignalWire
C2C service to allow you to embed calls in your website.

## Parameters

| Parameter            | Type    | Required | Default   | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [buttonId]           | string  | Yes      | -         | ID for Button that triggers call                            |
| [token]              | string  | Yes      | -         | Authentication token (c2c or embeds)                        |
| [callDetails]        | object  | Yes      | -         | Call configuration JSON                                     |
| [collectUserDetails] | boolean | No       | true      | Show user details form boolean                              |
| [survey]             | object  | No       | not shown | Post-call survey config JSON                                |
| [userVariables]      | object  | No       | {}        | Custom call variables JSON (arbitrary JSON key:value pairs) |

[buttonId]: #buttonid
[token]: #token
[callDetails]: #calldetails
[collectUserDetails]: #collectuserdetails
[survey]: #survey
[userVariables]: #uservariables

### `buttonId`

The `buttonId` attribute is used to specify the ID of the HTML button element that will trigger the call.

If the button is not found, the widget will **wait** for the button to be created. (The button doesn't have to exist in the DOM at the time of widget initialization.)

You can use the class `.demo-button-disabled` to disable the button while the widget is loading. The widget will remove that particular
class once it loads.

```html
<style>
  /* This class will be removed from button when the widget loads.
   */
  .demo-button-disabled {
    opacity: 0.7;
    pointer-events: none;
  }
</style>
```

### `token`

Authentication token for SignalWire services (either the c2c token from the dashboard, or the embed token).

Using C2C token is getting recommended for most cases. You can get the C2C token from the SignalWire Space dashboard.
You can get the embed token using the [Embeds Token](https://developer.signalwire.com/rest/signalwire-rest/endpoints/fabric/embeds-tokens) API.

You can also use any token received from the Call Fabric authentication, assuming it has the necessary permissions to the address.

### `callDetails`

The `callDetails` object is used to configure the call including destination and media support:

- `destination`: string - Call destination
- `supportsVideo`: boolean - Enable/disable video
- `supportsAudio`: boolean - Enable/disable audio

Strict JSON format is required for this attribute.

### `collectUserDetails`

Whether to show a form collecting user details before starting call.

### `survey`

The survey object is used to configure the post-call survey:

- `title`: string - Survey modal title (optional, defaults to "Would you like to take a survey?")
- `description`: string - Survey description text (optional, defaults to "We would love to hear your thoughts. Would you like to take a survey? It only takes 2 minutes.")
- `href`: string - URL to survey (required)

Don't set this attribute if you don't want a survey to be shown.

Strict JSON format is required for this attribute.

### `userVariables`

Custom variables to attach to the call session. Can be any JSON key:value pair. The following will be overridden by the widget, however:

```
callOriginHref - the URL of the page where the widget is hosted
userName - the name of the user (if they input it in the form)
userEmail - the email of the user (if they input it in the form)
userPhone - the phone number of the user (if they input it in the form)
```

Strict JSON format is required for this attribute.

## Events

### `beforecall`

This event is triggered when the call is about to start.

```javascript
const widget = document.querySelector("c2c-widget");
widget.addEventListener("beforecall", () => {
  console.log("beforecall");
});
```

## Detailed Attribute Description

### Required Attributes

#### `token`

Your SignalWire authentication token. This is required for establishing connections.

Example:

```html
<call-widget token="your_signalwire_token"></call-widget>
```

#### `destination`

The destination path for the call. Usually in the format "/private/room-name".

Example:

```

### Optional Attributes

#### `window-mode`

Controls the layout and features of the call window. Available options:

- `video+transcript`: Video call with transcript
- `video`: Video-only interface
- `audio+transcript`: Audio call with transcript

Example:

```html
<call-widget window-mode="video+transcript"></call-widget>
```

- `debug`: Most verbose, includes all logs
- `info`: General information and important events
- `warn`: Warnings and non-critical issues
- `error`: Only error messages (default)

```

#### `user-variables`

Custom variables passed as a JSON string. All values must be strings.

></call-widget>
```

#### `audio-codec`

Comma-separated list of preferred audio codecs.

```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Audio-Only Call Widget

```html
<button id="audioCall">Start Audio Call</button>

<call-widget
  button-id="audioCall"
  token="your_token"
  destination="/private/audio-room"
  support-audio="true"
  support-video="false"
  window-mode="audio+transcript"
></call-widget>
```

### Video Call with Transcription

```html
<button id="videoCall">Start Video Call</button>

<call-widget
  button-id="videoCall"
  token="your_token"
  destination="/private/video-room"
  support-audio="true"
  support-video="true"
  window-mode="video+transcript"
  log-level="info"
></call-widget>
```

### Call Center Agent Setup

```html
<button id="agentConsole">Open Agent Console</button>

<call-widget
  button-id="agentConsole"
  token="your_token"
  destination="/private/agent-room"
  support-audio="true"
  support-video="true"
  receive-calls="true"
  auto-answer="false"
  window-mode="video+transcript"
  user-variables='{"agentId": "agent123", "department": "support"}'
></call-widget>
```

## Notes and best practices

1. **Token Security**: Never hardcode your SignalWire token in the HTML. Instead, fetch it dynamically from your server.
   However, you're free to use click2call tokens (`c2c_...`) statically in HTML.

2. **Button Placement**: The trigger button can be styled and positioned anywhere in your layout. Just ensure the `button-id` matches.

3. **window-mode vs support-audio and support-video**:

- `window-mode` controls the layout UI of the widget. This is purely cosmetic.
- `support-audio` and `support-video` controls the features of the widget. This decides if webcam and/or microphone is used.

## Handling Incoming Calls

V3 introduces robust support for incoming calls, making it suitable for call center and customer service applications.

### Setting Up Incoming Calls

To enable incoming calls, set the `receive-calls` attribute to "true". You can also configure automatic answer behavior using `auto-answer`.

```html
<call-widget
  button-id="agentConsole"
  token="your_token"
  destination="/private/agent-room"
  receive-calls="true"
  auto-answer="false"
  window-mode="video+transcript"
></call-widget>
```

### Incoming Call Behavior

When `receive-calls` is enabled:

1. The widget listens for incoming calls to the specified destination
2. When a call arrives:
   - If `auto-answer="true"`: The call is automatically answered
   - If `auto-answer="false"`: A notification appears allowing the user to accept or decline
3. The call window opens in the specified `window-mode` once the call is accepted

### Best Practices for Incoming Calls

1. **User Experience**:
   - Use `auto-answer="false"` for agent interfaces where call screening is needed
   - Use `auto-answer="true"` for automated services or IVR systems
2. **Window Mode**: For agent interfaces, `video+transcript` mode provides the most comprehensive call handling experience
3. **Audio/Video Support**: Configure `support-audio` and `support-video` based on your use case:
   ```html
   <call-widget
     receive-calls="true"
     support-audio="true"
     support-video="true"
     window-mode="video+transcript"
   ></call-widget>
   ```
